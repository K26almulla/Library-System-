# HCI Library Management System

The HCI Library Management System is a web-based application designed to streamline library operations for students, librarians, and administrators. It includes features such as:
- Admin Panel: Add, view, delete, and search for students and librarians.
- Librarian Dashboard: Approve/Reject book borrow requests, manage book inventory, and track overdue books.
- Student Portal: Sign up, log in, borrow books, manage user profiles, and track order history.
- Book Management: Search, filter, and purchase books with multiple payment options.
- User-friendly UI: Supports meeting scheduling, cart management, and real-time notifications.
  
This project focuses on enhancing Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) principles for an efficient and accessible library experience.
