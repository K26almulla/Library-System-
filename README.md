# HCI Library Management System

The HCI Library Management System is a web-based application designed to streamline library operations for students, librarians, and administrators. It includes features such as:
- Admin Panel: Add, view, delete, and search for students and librarians.
- Librarian Dashboard: Approve/Reject book borrow requests, manage book inventory, and track overdue books.
- Student Portal: Sign up, log in, borrow books, manage user profiles, and track order history.
- Book Management: Search, filter, and purchase books with multiple payment options.
- User-friendly UI: Supports meeting scheduling, cart management, and real-time notifications.
  
This project focuses on enhancing Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) principles for an efficient and accessible library experience.

The interface design was crafted using Figma and Sketch, ensuring:

- Intuitive navigation – Easy-to-use menus and clear workflows.
- User-centric design – Accessibility-focused layouts for students, librarians, and admins.
- Prototype testing – Interactive mockups were tested to refine user experience before development.
- Consistent visual identity – Clean typography, color schemes, and iconography for a modern look.
